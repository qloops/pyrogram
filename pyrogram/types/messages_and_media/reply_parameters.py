class ReplyParameters(Object):
    """Describes reply parameters for the message that is being sent.

    Parameters:
        message_id  (``int``, *optional*):
            Identifier of the message that will be replied to in the current chat, or in the chat chat_id if it is specified.

        story_id  (``int``, *optional*):
            Unique identifier for the story in the chat.

        chat_id (``int`` | ``str``, *optional*):
            Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
            For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
            For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

        quote (``str``, *optional*):
            Quoted part of the message to be replied to, 0-1024 characters after entities parsing.
            The quote must be an exact substring of the message to be replied to, including bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, spoiler, and custom_emoji entities.
            The message will fail to send if the quote isn't found in the original message.

        quote_parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
            By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.

        quote_entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`, *optional*):
            List of special entities that appear in message text, which can be specified instead of *quote_parse_mode*.
