        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.
                For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self".
                For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).

            gift_id (``int``):
                Unique identifier of star gift.
                To get all available star gifts use :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.get_available_gifts`.

            text (``str``, *optional*):
                Text that will be shown along with the gift, 0-128 characters.

            parse_mode (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ParseMode`, *optional*):
                By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles.
                You can combine both syntaxes together.

            entities (List of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.MessageEntity`, *optional*):
                List of special entities that appear in message text, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.

            is_private (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to show gift text and sender only to the gift receiver. Otherwise, everyone will be able to see them.

            pay_for_upgrade (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to additionally pay for the gift upgrade and allow the receiver to upgrade it for free.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message`: On success, the sent message is returned.

            .. code-block:: python
